    "- Classification is probably the most popular task that you would deal with in real life.\n",
    "Text in the form of blogs, posts, articles, etc. is written every second. It is a challenge to predict the\n",
    "information about the writer without knowing about him/her.\n",

    "- We have designed it as a Multilabel classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Dataset**\n",
    "- Over 600,000 posts from more than 19 thousand bloggers\n",
    "- The Blog Authorship Corpus consists of the collected posts of 19,320 bloggers gathered from\n",
    "blogger.com in August 2004. The corpus incorporates a total of __681,288 posts and over 140 million\n",
    "words - or approximately 35 posts and 7250 words per person.__\n",
    "- Each blog is presented as a separate file, the name of which indicates a blogger id# and the\n",

    "    - 2994 \"30s\" blogs (ages 33-47)\n",
    "- For each age group, there is an equal number of male and female bloggers.\n",
    "Each blog in the corpus includes at least 200 occurrences of common English words. All formatting\n",

Thank goodness they were 1 1/2 hours late.  We got a lot done - plus did some 'stash-and-dash'.  Of course as soon as Mom got there she pointed out all the stuff on the stairwell I forgot about.   Grandma was no trouble and after I drank coffee (Mom stress, I guess) I ate well all morning and afternoon.  I started with a few bananas in the morning and an hour or so later I ate a almost a whole canteloupe.  I was trying to get the kids to eat it, but they didn't want much.  In the afternoon I ate a nectarine.  By dinnertime I was really hungry.  I know I need to eat more during the day, but I don't feel so hungry until I smell dinner cooking.  Bill made chicken wings, string beans, and rice.   I read another article about how rushing into going 100% raw is way too severe for most people.  It pretty much made me feel better about the rate I'm going.  Ideally, any cooked food I eat should be vegan or at least vegetarian, but I'm only two weeks into this and I know I'll get there.  I ordered a couple of 'raw' books.  The onle by Shazzie and the one by Alissa Cohen.  It will definitely help me to have these in front of me and always visible for constant motivation.   Dd (8), Julia, has mild ADD and I have her on a homeopathic/vitamin therapy called Attend by Vaxa.  It's been several weeks and I don't see much, if any, improvement.  Maybe I need to give it more time.  I'm expecting the second bottle today.  I'm going to encourage her to go raw with me.  I know raw living is good for mental clarity and has helped kids with ADD.  The Hallelujah Acres website mentions Barleygreen (Barleymax?)  as an essential supplement.  It's supposed to be great for kids with ADD - along with a high raw diet.  I'm going to try that very soon, too.  I'm also trying behavior modification, and maybe neurofeedback somewhere in the future.  I will never put her on medication.   So, the weekly stats are exactly the same as last week.  I think I'm going to do things a bit differently this week.  I know the books will help.  I want to see a change by next Sunday!</td>\n",

I don't think I would have been able to make the drive home at 10pm.  I was worried about eating, but did ok under the circumstances.  I ate half of my last mango Friday morning followed by coffee and a roll for the drive up.  At the park I had a beautiful, huge salad for lunch with a bottle of Poland Spring.  I felt so good after that.  Dinner and this morning's breakfast was a different story.  Now that we're home, though, I'm doing good.  I just had a red plum and am about to have some Greek salad that Bill is making.  His has feta, mine won't , but it has romaine, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, and green pepper.   It's getting a little easier to break old habits and not eat like a pig just because everyone else is.  I really    love   food and   I'm glad I can eat a lot of the raw food and still feel in control.  Grandma is coming over tomorrow.  We kind of have to 'babysit' her since Mom and Dad are going to a party and Gram has dementia and can't be alone.  I'm happy to, though.  She's no trouble.  I try out a few raw things on her sometimes when I go visit (she lives with my parents) and she really likes them - especially carrot juice.  It's funny, after carrot juice, Grandma starts walking around the house a lot.  I guess it really does give you energy!        Tomorrow I weigh myself.  Sigh.  I didn't do all that great this week, so I probably haven't lost anything yet.  No matter, it'll just motivate me to do better next week.</td>\n",

       "      <td>urlLink     I  felt kind of energetic today . I slept pretty good last night and got up at 8. I wanted to do so much today with the kids, but when the house is a mess I can't go anywhere until it's presentable. The kids really enjoy just going out on the block to ride bikes or play tag with friends, but we never got a chance to get out. Guilt. Well, we're going to Six Flags tomorrow, so that should make up for today!    I cut up another mango this morning. I onlyhave 2 left so I better get shopping. Bill's going tonight so I have to remember to tell him to pick some up. Later on I ate a few almonds and a few dried currants and at around 4pm I had a huge amount of watermelon. I actually feel full without feeling like I ate too much. Cool.  Kait made pasta alfredo for dinner. I will probably have a very small bowl of it with a very big salad. And I only had 2 cigs today. I may have one more after dinner though. Wow, I usually have about 10 a day. This week is going nicely so far.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wow, I love fruit.  I read that in order to lose weight with raw food, you shouldn't eat stuff with a lot of fat or sweet fruits.  Of course my favorite things are stuff with a lot of fat and sweet fruits.  This morning I started with a banana.  Then I had such a delicious mango a little while later.  I never had mangos growing up.  We were your basic Northern European, Irish, English, Italian family complete with huge amounts of cooked food.  The only raw things I remember eating was an apple and banana here and there, celery (with cream cheese on it) and that bag of nuts at Thanksgiving, and the occasional salad after we moved in with my Italian stepdad.  We thought mangos and coconuts were weird and only saw them in the Spanish bodegas down the street.  Now I can't live without those.   A few hours later we all shared a big bowl of red grapes.  I feel so good after only fruit in the morning.  When I started this new way of eating, I knew I'd have to take it slow in order to stick with it and I decided the only step I will take for now is having only fruit in the morning.  I've done that before with Fit for Life, Somersizing, and Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover.  I do stay raw usually until dinnertime, so I feel I'm ahead of the game.  Today's lunch and dinner were disastrous so let's not even go there.   I'm drinking mainly spring water or fresh juice now - no more pepsi or iced tea.  And I had 4 cigs today.  Maybe I'll quit before my birthday.  The better I feel, the less I want to smoke.  Tomorrow I'll break out that pilates tape I've been meaning to get to.  I only had 3 hours of sleep last night (because I had coffee at mom's last night so I wouldn't fall asleep driving home and it kept me awake until 5am!)  so I'm off to bed now.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to consider myself a rawfoodist.  Yes, I like to make it one word.  I love the whole concept.  I feel I have the gist of it down, but I'm still reading everything I can get my hands on about the subject.  Can changing one's diet like this really change the person?  I want to change.  I haven't been too thrilled with myself lately.  After 3 kids, my weight is up there and I look and feel like hell.  I started adding more and more raw food into my life a couple of weeks ago, but this week is my true beginning.  I am in love with the idea of natural hygiene and living the way I know we're supposed to.   I'm in what they call a 'transitional' phase right now.  I am eating a few complicated meals trying to get the taste and feel of cooked crappy food.   But I do appreciate the simple, mono foods as well.  I think I'm at around 75% raw at the moment with the expectation of getting to 95% in the near future.  The fun part of this whole thing is that I'm tasting new things such as young coconut, dates, and berries that are fresh and organic and not smushed little pathetic plastic-y things found in frozen pancakes.   Let me tell you what I ate today.  I started the morning with coffee.  Ok, I'm down to one cup one or two mornings a week.  Not bad for someone who relied on that thrice daily caffeine jolt just to get some housework done.  Lets pretend I didn't have that.  Anyway, I ate a banana and drove with everyone out to my mom's.  Bill (hubby dearest) took off today to spend some family time.  I actually brought a huge bage of food and my old juicer.   We stopped off at 7-11 where the kids all got a free slurpee (and Bill too)  and I got a great looking, huge salad for $3.99.  At mom's I cut up a nice mango and threw it in the salad (instead of dressing).  That was actually really yummy.  I never thought mango and onions would taste ok together (then Bill reminded me that Bobby Flay made mango salsa once).   Later on I juiced a bunch of carrots with a bit of apple - Kait (10) had some, too.  She loves fresh juice - and makes killer smoothies.  At dinnertime Dad ordered out pizza and salad.  So I had one slice of pizza with a giant sized plate of salad.  Hey, I'm not perfect.  I ended the night with one glass of zinfandel and totalled about 5 cigarettes for the day.  I am quitting this vile habit on my 35th birthday which is in exactly 22 days.   Most days are like this - last week was worse - next week will be better.  I really do love eating raw.  I have a bit of a hard time with peer pressure/will power/power of suggestion - call it what you want.  I'm overcoming that as well.

       "681156  4260903  ...                   I ran around cleaning all morning because Grandma (and Mom and Dad) was coming at 11am.  we went nuts and the whole family was actually helping.  Thank goodness they were 1 1/2 hours late.  We got a lot done - plus did some 'stash-and-dash'.  Of course as soon as Mom got there she pointed out all the stuff on the stairwell I forgot about.   Grandma was no trouble and after I drank coffee (Mom stress, I guess) I ate well all morning and afternoon.  I started with a few bananas in the morning and an hour or so later I ate a almost a whole canteloupe.  I was trying to get the kids to eat it, but they didn't want much.  In the afternoon I ate a nectarine.  By dinnertime I was really hungry.  I know I need to eat more during the day, but I don't feel so hungry until I smell dinner cooking.  Bill made chicken wings, string beans, and rice.   I read another article about how rushing into going 100% raw is way too severe for most people.  It pretty much made me feel better about the rate I'm going.  Ideally, any cooked food I eat should be vegan or at least vegetarian, but I'm only two weeks into this and I know I'll get there.  I ordered a couple of 'raw' books.  The onle by Shazzie and the one by Alissa Cohen.  It will definitely help me to have these in front of me and always visible for constant motivation.   Dd (8), Julia, has mild ADD and I have her on a homeopathic/vitamin therapy called Attend by Vaxa.  It's been several weeks and I don't see much, if any, improvement.  Maybe I need to give it more time.  I'm expecting the second bottle today.  I'm going to encourage her to go raw with me.  I know raw living is good for mental clarity and has helped kids with ADD.  The Hallelujah Acres website mentions Barleygreen (Barleymax?)  as an essential supplement.  It's supposed to be great for kids with ADD - along with a high raw diet.  I'm going to try that very soon, too.  I'm also trying behavior modification, and maybe neurofeedback somewhere in the future.  I will never put her on medication.   So, the weekly stats are exactly the same as last week.  I think I'm going to do things a bit differently this week.  I know the books will help.  I want to see a change by next Sunday!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

No matter, it'll just motivate me to do better next week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "681158  4260903  ...                    urlLink     I  felt kind of energetic today . I slept pretty good last night and got up at 8. I wanted to do so much today with the kids, but when the house is a mess I can't go anywhere until it's presentable. The kids really enjoy just going out on the block to ride bikes or play tag with friends, but we never got a chance to get out. Guilt. Well, we're going to Six Flags tomorrow, so that should make up for today!    I cut up another mango this morning. I onlyhave 2 left so I better get shopping. Bill's going tonight so I have to remember to tell him to pick some up. Later on I ate a few almonds and a few dried currants and at around 4pm I had a huge amount of watermelon. I actually feel full without feeling like I ate too much. Cool.  Kait made pasta alfredo for dinner. I will probably have a very small bowl of it with a very big salad. And I only had 2 cigs today. I may have one more after dinner though. Wow, I usually have about 10 a day. This week is going nicely so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "681159  4260903  ...                   Wow, I love fruit.  I read that in order to lose weight with raw food, you shouldn't eat stuff with a lot of fat or sweet fruits.  Of course my favorite things are stuff with a lot of fat and sweet fruits.  This morning I started with a banana.  Then I had such a delicious mango a little while later.  I never had mangos growing up.  We were your basic Northern European, Irish, English, Italian family complete with huge amounts of cooked food.  The only raw things I remember eating was an apple and banana here and there, celery (with cream cheese on it) and that bag of nuts at Thanksgiving, and the occasional salad after we moved in with my Italian stepdad.  We thought mangos and coconuts were weird and only saw them in the Spanish bodegas down the street.  Now I can't live without those.   A few hours later we all shared a big bowl of red grapes.  I feel so good after only fruit in the morning.  When I started this new way of eating, I knew I'd have to take it slow in order to stick with it and I decided the only step I will take for now is having only fruit in the morning.  I've done that before with Fit for Life, Somersizing, and Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover.  I do stay raw usually until dinnertime, so I feel I'm ahead of the game.  Today's lunch and dinner were disastrous so let's not even go there.   I'm drinking mainly spring water or fresh juice now - no more pepsi or iced tea.  And I had 4 cigs today.  Maybe I'll quit before my birthday.  The better I feel, the less I want to smoke.  Tomorrow I'll break out that pilates tape I've been meaning to get to.  I only had 3 hours of sleep last night (because I had coffee at mom's last night so I wouldn't fall asleep driving home and it kept me awake until 5am!)  so I'm off to bed now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "681160  4260903  ...                   I want to consider myself a rawfoodist.  Yes, I like to make it one word.  I love the whole concept.  I feel I have the gist of it down, but I'm still reading everything I can get my hands on about the subject.  Can changing one's diet like this really change the person?  I want to change.  I haven't been too thrilled with myself lately.  After 3 kids, my weight is up there and I look and feel like hell.  I started adding more and more raw food into my life a couple of weeks ago, but this week is my true beginning.  I am in love with the idea of natural hygiene and living the way I know we're supposed to.   I'm in what they call a 'transitional' phase right now.  I am eating a few complicated meals trying to get the taste and feel of cooked crappy food.   But I do appreciate the simple, mono foods as well.  I think I'm at around 75% raw at the moment with the expectation of getting to 95% in the near future.  The fun part of this whole thing is that I'm tasting new things such as young coconut, dates, and berries that are fresh and organic and not smushed little pathetic plastic-y things found in frozen pancakes.   Let me tell you what I ate today.  I started the morning with coffee.  Ok, I'm down to one cup one or two mornings a week.  Not bad for someone who relied on that thrice daily caffeine jolt just to get some housework done.  Lets pretend I didn't have that.  Anyway, I ate a banana and drove with everyone out to my mom's.  Bill (hubby dearest) took off today to spend some family time.  I actually brought a huge bage of food and my old juicer.   We stopped off at 7-11 where the kids all got a free slurpee (and Bill too)  and I got a great looking, huge salad for $3.99.  At mom's I cut up a nice mango and threw it in the salad (instead of dressing).  That was actually really yummy.  I never thought mango and onions would taste ok together (then Bill reminded me that Bobby Flay made mango salsa once).   Later on I juiced a bunch of carrots with a bit of apple - Kait (10) had some, too.  She loves fresh juice - and makes killer smoothies.  At dinnertime Dad ordered out pizza and salad.  So I had one slice of pizza with a giant sized plate of salad.  Hey, I'm not perfect.  I ended the night with one glass of zinfandel and totalled about 5 cigarettes for the day.  I am quitting this vile habit on my 35th birthday which is in exactly 22 days.   Most days are like this - last week was worse - next week will be better.  I really do love eating raw.  I have a bit of a hard time with peer pressure/will power/power of suggestion - call it what you want.  I'm overcoming that as well.

How to Build an H-Bomb Making and owning an H-bomb is the kind of challenge real Americans seek. Who wants to be a passive victim of nuclear war when, with a little effort, you can be an active participant? Bomb shelters are for losers. Who wants to huddle together underground eating canned Spam? Winners want to push the button themselves. Making your own H-bomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training -- it's called Taking Charge. We're sure you'll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken. Introduction When the Feds clamped down on The Progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb, it piqued our curiosity. Was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an H-bomb in your own kitchen? Seven Days decided to find out. Food editor Barbara Ehrenreich, investigative reporter Peter Biskind, Photographer Jane Melnick and nuclear scientist Michio Kaku were given three days to cook up a workable H-bomb. They did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you. Not that Seven Days supports nuclear terrorism. We don't. We would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like low-level radiation, microwaves, DDT, DBCP, aflatoxins, PBBs, PBCs, or food dyes, rather than unexpectedly, say as hostage to a Latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb. In our view the real terrorists are the governments, American, Soviet, French, Chinese, and British, that are hoarding H-bombs for their own use, and worse still, those governments (U.S., French and German) that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina so that they can make their own bombs. When these bombs are used, and they will be, it will be the world's big-time nuclear peddlers, along with corporate suppliers like General Electric, Westinghouse, and Gulf Oil, that we can thank for it. Gagging The Progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out. The heart of the successful H-bomb is the successful A-bomb. Once you've got your A-bombs made the rest is frosting on the cake. All you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate they'll start off a hydrogen-fusion reaction.  Part 1: Making Your Bomb Step 1: Getting the Ingredients Uranium is the basic ingredient of the A-bomb. When a uranium atom's nucleus splits apart, it releases a tremendous amount of energy (for its size), and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei, releasing more energy, in what is called a 'chain reaction'. (When atoms split, matter is converted into energy according to Einstein's equation E=MC2. What better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks?) There are two kinds (isotopes) of uranium: the rare U-235, used in bombs, and the more common, heavier, but useless U-238. Natural uranium contains less than 1 percent U-235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be 'enriched' to 90 percent U-235 and only 10 percent U-238. Plutonium-239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for U-235. Ten pounds of U-235 (or slightly less plutonium) is all that is necessary for a bomb. Less than ten pounds won't give you a critical mass. So purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle. It is infinitely easy to steal ready-to-use enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself. And stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds. There are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium... Enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. From there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal. Each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of U-235, and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment. Conversion facilities exist at Hematite, Missouri; Apollo, Pennsylvania; and Erwin, Tennessee. The Kerr-McGee plant at Crescent Oklahoma -- where Karen Silkwood worked -- was a conversion plant that 'lost' 40 lbs of plutonium. Enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuel-fabricating plants like those in New Haven, San Diego; or Lynchburg, Virginia. (A former Kerr-McGee supervisor, James V. Smith, when asked at the Silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft, testified that 'There were none of any kind, no guards, no fences, no nothing.') Plutonium can be obtained from places like United Nuclear in Pawling, New York; Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin, Tennessee; General Electric in Pleasanton, California; Westinghouse in Cheswick, Pennsylvania; Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) in Leechburg, Pennsylvania; and plants in Hanfford, Washington and Morris, Illinois. According to Rolling Stone magazine the Israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from NUMEC. Finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while it's en-route from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants. It is usually transported (by air or truck) in the form of uranium oxide, a brownish powder resembling instant coffee, or as a metal, coming in small chunks called 'broken buttons.' Both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5-inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums. The drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked 'Fissible Material' or 'Danger, Plutonium.' A typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio to the conversion plant in Hematite Missouri then to Kansas City by truck where it would be flown to Los Angeles and then trucked down to the General Atomic plant in San Diego. The plans for the General Atomic plant are on file at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's reading room at 1717 H Street NW Washington. A Xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public. If you can't get hold of any enriched uranium you'll have to settle for commercial grade (20 percent U-235). This can be stolen from university reactors of a type called TRIGA Mark II, where security is even more casual than at commercial plants. If stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it. Unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for $23 a pound. Commercial grade (3 to 20 percent enriched) is available for $40 a pound from Gulf Atomic. You'll have to enrich it further yourself. Quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass. You'll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercial-grade uranium. (It's only 20 percent U-235 at best, and you need 10 pounds of U-235 so... ) But with a little kitchen-table chemistry you'll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide you've purchased into a liquid form. Once you've done that, you'll be able to separate the U-235 that you'll need from the U-238. First pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide, converting it to uranium tetrafluoride. (Safety note: Concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass, so store it only in plastic. Used 1-gallon plastic milk containers will do.) Now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride, the gaseous form of uranium, which is convenient for separating out the isotope U-235 from U-238. To get the hexafluoride form, bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride. Fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemical-supply firms. Be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine, the classic World War I poison gas. Chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood (the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors). If you've done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching. In the old horse-and-buggy days of A-bomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes, tubes, and membranes, until the U-235 was eventually separated from the U-238. This gaseous-diffusion process, as it was called is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Gaseous-diffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of $2-billion each. So forget it. There are easier, and cheaper, ways to enrich your uranium. First transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure. You can use a bicycle pump for this. Then make a simple home centrifuge. Fill a standard-size bucket one-quarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride. Attach a six-foot rope to the bucket handle. Now swing the rope (and attached bucket) around your head as fast as possible. Keep this up for about 45 minutes. Slow down gradually, and very gently put the bucket on the floor. The U-235, which is lighter, will have risen to the top, where it can be skimmed off like cream. Repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium. (Safety note: Don't put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket. Use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room. This will prevent the premature build-up of a critical mass.) Now it's time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form. This is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium (available in tablet form from your drugstore) into each bucket of uranium. The calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride, a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal. A few precautions: • While uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts you'll be handling, if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron, the kind you can buy in dental supply stores. • Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known. If inhaled, a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs, a painful way to go. Even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer. If eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium. It goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells. The best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it. If this is too difficult wear a mask. To avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule: never make an A-bomb on an empty stomach. • If you find yourself dozing off while you're working, or if you begin to glow in the dark, it might be wise to take a blood count. Prick your finger with a sterile pin, place a drop of blood on a microscope slide, cover it with a cover slip, and examine under a microscope. (Best results are obtained in the early morning.) When you get leukemia, immature cells are released into the bloodstream, and usually the number of white cells increases (though this increase might take almost 2 weeks). Red blood cells look kind of like donuts (without the hole), and are slightly smaller than the white cells, each of which has a nucleus. Immature red cells look similar to white cells (i.e.. slightly larger and have a nucleus). If you have more than about 1 white cell (including immature ones) to 400 red cells then start to worry. But, depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb, a short life expectancy might not be a problem.  Step 2: Assembling the A-Bomb Now that you've acquired the enriched uranium, all that's left is to assemble your A-bomb. Go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls. You also want to separate your 10 pounds of U-235 into two hunks. (Keep them apart!) The idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl. Take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl. Uranium is malleable, like gold, so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit. Take another five-pound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl. These two bowls of U-235 are the 'subcritical masses' which, when brought together forcefully, will provide the critical mass that makes your A-bomb go. Keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you don't want them to 'go critical' on you... At least not yet. Now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside, open ends facing each other, no less than seven inches apart, using masking tape to set them up in position. The reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner, in case you're wondering, is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion. 'A loose neutron is a useless neutron' as the A-bomb pioneers used to say. As far as the A-bomb goes, you're almost done. The final problem is to figure out how to get the two U-235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction. Almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together. Gunpowder, for example, is easily made at home from potassium nitrate, sulfur, and carbon. Or, you can get some blasting caps or TNT. (Buy them or steal them from a construction site.) Best of all is C4 plastic explosive. You can mold it around your bowls, and it's fairly safe to work with. (But, it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room, and THEN fit it to your uranium-packed bowls. This is particularly true in winter, when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the C4. A responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary.) Once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries, a switch, and some wire. Remember though that it is essential that the two charges -- one on each side of the casing -- go off simultaneously. Now put the whole thing in the casing of an old Hoover vacuum cleaner and you're finished with this part of the process. The rest is easy.  Step 3: Make More A-Bombs Following the Directions Above  A Word to the Wise About Wastes After your A-bomb is completed you'll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like U-238. These are not dangerous, but you do have to get rid of them. You can flush leftovers down the toilet. (Don't worry about polluting the ocean, there is already so much radioactive waste there, a few more bucketfuls won't make any waves whatsoever.) If you're the fastidious type -- the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies -- you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard, just like Uncle Sam does. If the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn, tell them to play over by the waste. You'll soon find that they're spending most of their time in bed.  Going First Class If you're like us, you're feeling the economic pinch, and you'll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible, consonant of course with reasonable yield. The recipe we've given is for a budget-pleasing H-bomb, no frills, no flourishes; it's just a simple 5-megaton bomb, capable of wiping out the New York metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay area, or Boston. But don't forget, your H-bomb will only be as good as the A-bombs in it. If you want to spend a little more money you can punch-up your A-bomb considerably. Instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand, you can buy a commercial centrifuge. (Fisher Scientific sells one for about $1000.) You also might want to be fussier about your design. The Hiroshima bomb, a relatively crude one, only fissioned 1 percent of it's uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons. In order to fission more of the uranium, the force of your explosive 'trigger' needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere; the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously. (It was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of trying to steal).  Part 2: Putting Your H-Bomb Together The heart of the H-bomb is the fusion process. Several A-bombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature (100 million degrees C) necessary to fuse lithium deuteride (LiD) into helium. When the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus, two helium nuclei are created, and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough, the result is an enormous amount of energy: the energy of the H-bomb. You don't have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride, it can be purchased from any chemical-supply house. It costs $1000 a pound. If your budget won't allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at $40 a pound. You will need at least 100 pounds. It's a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful. Place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four A-bombs in their casings. Attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously. The container for the whole thing is no problem. They can be placed anywhere: Inside an old stereo console, a discarded refrigerator, etc... When the detonator sets off the four A-bombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations. This will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees C fast enough (a few billionths of a second) so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse. The result, at least 1000 times the punch of the puny A-bomb that leveled Hiroshima (20 million tons of TNT vs. 20 thousand tons.)  Part 3: What to do With Your Bomb Now that you have a fully assembled H-bomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering, 'What should I do with it?' Every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences, but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the American government. 1. Sell Your Bomb and Make a Pile of Money In these days of rising inflation, increasing unemployment, and an uncertain economic outlook, few businesses make as much sense as weapons production. If your career forecast is cloudy, bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare, or unemployment. Regardless of your present income level, a home H-bomb business can be an invaluable income supplement, and certainly a profitable alternative to selling Tupperware or pirated Girl Scout cookies. Unfortunately for the family bomb business, big government has already cornered a large part of the world market. But this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers. The raid on Entebee was the Waterloo of hijacking, and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across. They'd jump at the chance to get hold of an H-bomb. Emerging nations which can't ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from G.E. or Westinghouse are also shopping around. You may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations, or groups, whose goals you may disapprove of. But here again, take a tip from our government: forget ideology -- it's cash that counts. And remember, H-bomb sales have a way of escalating, almost like a chain reaction. Suppose you make a sale to South Yemen which you believe to be a Soviet puppet. Well within a few days some discrete inquiries from North Yemen and possibly the Saudis, the Egyptians and the Ethiopians as well can be expected. Similarly, a sale to the IRA will generate a sale to the Ulster government; and a sale to the Tanzanians will bring the Ugandans running, and so forth. It doesn't matter WHICH side you're on, only how many sides there are. Don't forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer. As the experience of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. has shown, each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for H-bombs. No customer -- no matter how small -- can ever have too many. 2. Use Your Bomb at Home Many families are attracted to the H-bomb simply as a 'deterrent.' A discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying 'This Home Protected by H-bomb' will discourage IRS investigators, census takers, and Jehovah's Witnesses. You'll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up. And once the news gets out that you are a home H-bomb owner you'll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates. So relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home H-bomb ownership!  Is It For You? Let's be honest. The H-bomb isn't for everyone. Frankly there are people who can't handle it. They break out in hives at the very mention of mega-death, fallout, or radiation sickness. The following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home H-bomb ownership. If you can answer 'yes' to six or more of these questions, then you're emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club. If not, a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea, try botulism-toxin, laser rays, or nerve gas. 1. I ignore the demands of others. 2. I subscribe to one or more of the following: Soldier of Fortune, Hustler, Popular Mechanics, Self. 3. Though I have many interesting acquaintances, I am my own best friend. 4. I know what to say after you say 'Hello,' but I am seldom interested in pursuing the conversation. 5. I have seen the movie 'The Deer Hunter' more than once. 6. I know that everyone can be a winner if they want to, and I resent whiners. 7. I own one or more of the following: handgun, video game, trash compactor, snowmobile. 8. I am convinced that leukemia is psychosomatic. 9. I am aware that most vegetarians are sexually impotent. 10. I have read evidence that solar energy is a Communist conspiracy.  Myths About Nuclear War Ever since the first mushroom cloud over Hiroshima ushered in the atomic age, a small group of nay-sayers and doom-mongers has lobbied, campaigned and demonstrated to convince Americans that H-bomb ownership, along with nuclear power, is dangerous and unhealthy. Using their virtual stranglehold over the media, these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war. They have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many Americans feeling demoralized and indecisive; not sure where the truth lies. Well, here are the myths, and here are the facts. Myth: After a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation. Fact: This is completely false. According to one scientist (quoted in John McPee's The Curve of Binding Energy) 'The largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons, and that is one-thousandth the force of an earthquake, one-thousandth the force of a hurricane. We have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time.' Another scientist adds, 'It is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth. That is far from the truth. To end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world, and probably a lot more.' Even if humans succumbed, many forms of life would survive a nuclear free-for-all, cockroaches, certain forms of bacteria, and lichens, for instance. Myth: Radiation is bad for you. Fact: Everything is bad for you if you have too much of it. If you eat too many bananas you'll get a stomach-ache. If you get too much sun you can get sunburned (or even skin cancer). Same thing with radiation. Too much may make you feel under the weather, but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that low-level radiation has any really serious adverse effects. And, high-level radiation may bring unexpected benefits. It speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones. (Remember the old saying, 'Two heads are better than one.') Nearer to home, it's plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds, and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes. (Many survivors of the Hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and it's attendant problems forever.) We hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had.





       "4                 Thanks to Yahoo!'s Toolbar I can now 'capture' the URLs of popups...which means now I can show you some cool links to Korean Pop (K-Pop) audio and video without the need to relate instructions like: 'go to the site, click on the pop-audio button then choose...'.

       "5                 I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning.  We were talking about where Koreans put their money.  Invariably, they have a lot of real estate and cash.  (Cash would include short term investments under one year as well as savings accounts.)  The reason?  Real estate makes money here.  A lot of money.  I've seen surveys of Seoul real estate rising about 10-15% PER YEAR for long stretches, even after taking into account the 1997 Crisis (referred to as the IMF crisis here, although it was the IMF that bailed Korea out).  Compare that to Korean corporate bonds which fell 90-99% in 1997 and only modestly recovered, and a local stock market (represented by KOSPI, or their version of the Dow Jones Index) that has not gone appreciably above its 1980s high of 1,000 points (it is now about 800 points, see  urlLink link ) and you can see why real estate makes sense here.  But back to the conversation...I noted that here a 'real big' or 'elite' real estate investor has over 6 billion won (about USD 5,000,000, see  urlLink converter ) in properties.  Dad seemed a little flabbergasted.  'What the heck do they need 5 million dollars for?  They don't need that much to retire.'  Maybe so, but there is a lot of risk here too.  Take real estate (or any other South Korean asset) for example: if the North toots their horn louder or make a move on the country that 5,000,000 USD is worth about 5 cents.  Also, all of it is denominated in won which, during the 'IMF Crisis', dropped about 50% vis-a-vis the USD. Also, if you make a bad investment or some fall victim to a scam--the latest here was the  urlLink Good Morning City  project--you're toast.  I saw a lady on TV who lost everything in it.  Her comment (between the tears): 'Now I know what it's like to go from a rich person to a beggar in one day.'  If you have one of those, some saber-rattling from North Korea and a weak exchange rate your little nest egg could be almost wiped out.  The government has almost zero help for unemployed, disabled or otherwise disenfranchised workers.  The role of family is more important here...so if you have money you should help your family, and if you don't then you should go to them first.  Thus the idea that more is more.  Koreans go all out in most things they do, and investing is no different.  Why have one apartment when you can have 7?  The  urlLink jeonse  system supports this as well.  You see, if you have a 400,000 USD apartment and you rent it out there are two systems you can use in Korea (neither of which are the Western ones, except in rare circumstances).  1.  Renter signs a 2-year contract and deposits about half the market value (200,000 USD) with the owner.  No monthly rent is paid, but the owner can invest in Korean Treasury Bills for about 4-5% per year.  That's a monthly rent/return of $750.  At the end of the term the 200,000 USD is returned to the renter.  2.  Renter signs a 1-year or 2-year contract and deposits about 10%-20% of the market value of the property (10,000-20,000 USD) plus some monthly rent of $400-$600 a month.  In both cases, if the value of the property increases or decreases the jeonse will need to be topped-up or partially refunded.  (Of course I'm using USD in this to save my '0' key and to help 'foreigners' reference it better.)  Thus, if you buy a place for $400,000 you can turn around and rent it out and get $200,000 to (if you like) buy another place or whatever.  Since there are very, very few mortgages in Korea (kind of a cash society, although there are home-equity lines of credit) the system here is a bit different.  The key, of course, is that real estate prices keep going up.

the HTML It now validates to XHTML 10 Strict How to Build an HBomb Making and owning an Hbomb is the kind of challenge real Americans seek Who wants to be a passive victim of nuclear war when with a little effort you can be an active participant Bomb shelters are for losers Who wants to huddle together underground eating canned Spam Winners want to push the button themselves Making your own Hbomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training  its called Taking Charge Were sure youll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken Introduction When the Feds clamped down on The Progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb it piqued our curiosity Was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an Hbomb in your own kitchen Seven Days decided to find out Food editor Barbara Ehrenreich investigative reporter Peter Biskind Photographer Jane Melnick and nuclear scientist Michio Kaku were given three days to cook up a workable Hbomb They did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you Not that Seven Days supports nuclear terrorism We dont We would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like lowlevel radiation microwaves DDT DBCP aflatoxins PBBs PBCs or food dyes rather than unexpectedly say as hostage to a Latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb In our view the real terrorists are the governments American Soviet French Chinese and British that are hoarding Hbombs for their own use and worse still those governments US French and German that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like South Africa Brazil and Argentina so that they can make their own bombs When these bombs are used and they will be it will be the worlds bigtime nuclear peddlers along with corporate suppliers like General Electric Westinghouse and Gulf Oil that we can thank for it Gagging The Progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out The heart of the successful Hbomb is the successful Abomb Once youve got your Abombs made the rest is frosting on the cake All you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate theyll start off a hydrogenfusion reaction  Part 1 Making Your Bomb Step 1 Getting the Ingredients Uranium is the basic ingredient of the Abomb When a uranium atoms nucleus splits apart it releases a tremendous amount of energy for its size and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei releasing more energy in what is called a chain reaction When atoms split matter is converted into energy according to Einsteins equation EMC2 What better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks There are two kinds isotopes of uranium the rare U235 used in bombs and the more common heavier but useless U238 Natural uranium contains less than 1 percent U235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be enriched to 90 percent U235 and only 10 percent U238 Plutonium239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for U235 Ten pounds of U235 or slightly less plutonium is all that is necessary for a bomb Less than ten pounds wont give you a critical mass So purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle It is infinitely easy to steal readytouse enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself And stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds There are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium Enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in Portsmouth Ohio From there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal Each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of U235 and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment Conversion facilities exist at Hematite Missouri Apollo Pennsylvania and Erwin Tennessee The KerrMcGee plant at Crescent Oklahoma  where Karen Silkwood worked  was a conversion plant that lost 40 lbs of plutonium Enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuelfabricating plants like those in New Haven San Diego or Lynchburg Virginia A former KerrMcGee supervisor James V Smith when asked at the Silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft testified that There were none of any kind no guards no fences no nothing Plutonium can be obtained from places like United Nuclear in Pawling New York Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin Tennessee General Electric in Pleasanton California Westinghouse in Cheswick Pennsylvania Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation NUMEC in Leechburg Pennsylvania and plants in Hanfford Washington and Morris Illinois According to Rolling Stone magazine the Israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from NUMEC Finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while its enroute from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants It is usually transported by air or truck in the form of uranium oxide a brownish powder resembling instant coffee or as a metal coming in small chunks called broken buttons Both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums The drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked Fissible Material or Danger Plutonium A typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at Portsmouth Ohio to the conversion plant in Hematite Missouri then to Kansas City by truck where it would be flown to Los Angeles and then trucked down to the General Atomic plant in San Diego The plans for the General Atomic plant are on file at the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions reading room at 1717 H Street NW Washington A Xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public If you cant get hold of any enriched uranium youll have to settle for commercial grade 20 percent U235 This can be stolen from university reactors of a type called TRIGA Mark II where security is even more casual than at commercial plants If stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it Unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for 23 a pound Commercial grade 3 to 20 percent enriched is available for 40 a pound from Gulf Atomic Youll have to enrich it further yourself Quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass Youll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercialgrade uranium Its only 20 percent U235 at best and you need 10 pounds of U235 so  But with a little kitchentable chemistry youll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide youve purchased into a liquid form Once youve done that youll be able to separate the U235 that youll need from the U238 First pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide converting it to uranium tetrafluoride Safety note Concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass so store it only in plastic Used 1gallon plastic milk containers will do Now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride the gaseous form of uranium which is convenient for separating out the isotope U235 from U238 To get the hexafluoride form bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride Fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemicalsupply firms Be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine the classic World War I poison gas Chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors If youve done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching In the old horseandbuggy days of Abomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes tubes and membranes until the U235 was eventually separated from the U238 This gaseousdiffusion process as it was called is difficult timeconsuming and expensive Gaseousdiffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of 2billion each So forget it There are easier and cheaper ways to enrich your uranium First transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure You can use a bicycle pump for this Then make a simple home centrifuge Fill a standardsize bucket onequarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride Attach a sixfoot rope to the bucket handle Now swing the rope and attached bucket around your head as fast as possible Keep this up for about 45 minutes Slow down gradually and very gently put the bucket on the floor The U235 which is lighter will have risen to the top where it can be skimmed off like cream Repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium Safety note Dont put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket Use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room This will prevent the premature buildup of a critical mass Now its time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form This is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium available in tablet form from your drugstore into each bucket of uranium The calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal A few precautions  While uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts youll be handling if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron the kind you can buy in dental supply stores  Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known If inhaled a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs a painful way to go Even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer If eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium It goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells The best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it If this is too difficult wear a mask To avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule never make an Abomb on an empty stomach  If you find yourself dozing off while youre working or if you begin to glow in the dark it might be wise to take a blood count Prick your finger with a sterile pin place a drop of blood on a microscope slide cover it with a cover slip and examine under a microscope Best results are obtained in the early morning When you get leukemia immature cells are released into the bloodstream and usually the number of white cells increases though this increase might take almost 2 weeks Red blood cells look kind of like donuts without the hole and are slightly smaller than the white cells each of which has a nucleus Immature red cells look similar to white cells ie slightly larger and have a nucleus If you have more than about 1 white cell including immature ones to 400 red cells then start to worry But depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb a short life expectancy might not be a problem  Step 2 Assembling the ABomb Now that youve acquired the enriched uranium all thats left is to assemble your Abomb Go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls You also want to separate your 10 pounds of U235 into two hunks Keep them apart The idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl Take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl Uranium is malleable like gold so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit Take another fivepound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl These two bowls of U235 are the subcritical masses which when brought together forcefully will provide the critical mass that makes your Abomb go Keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you dont want them to go critical on you At least not yet Now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside open ends facing each other no less than seven inches apart using masking tape to set them up in position The reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner in case youre wondering is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion A loose neutron is a useless neutron as the Abomb pioneers used to say As far as the Abomb goes youre almost done The final problem is to figure out how to get the two U235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction Almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together Gunpowder for example is easily made at home from potassium nitrate sulfur and carbon Or you can get some blasting caps or TNT Buy them or steal them from a construction site Best of all is C4 plastic explosive You can mold it around your bowls and its fairly safe to work with But it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room and THEN fit it to your uraniumpacked bowls This is particularly true in winter when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the C4 A responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary Once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries a switch and some wire Remember though that it is essential that the two charges  one on each side of the casing  go off simultaneously Now put the whole thing in the casing of an old Hoover vacuum cleaner and youre finished with this part of the process The rest is easy  Step 3 Make More ABombs Following the Directions Above  A Word to the Wise About Wastes After your Abomb is completed youll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like U238 These are not dangerous but you do have to get rid of them You can flush leftovers down the toilet Dont worry about polluting the ocean there is already so much radioactive waste there a few more bucketfuls wont make any waves whatsoever If youre the fastidious type  the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies  you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard just like Uncle Sam does If the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn tell them to play over by the waste Youll soon find that theyre spending most of their time in bed  Going First Class If youre like us youre feeling the economic pinch and youll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible consonant of course with reasonable yield The recipe weve given is for a budgetpleasing Hbomb no frills no flourishes its just a simple 5megaton bomb capable of wiping out the New York metropolitan area the San Francisco Bay area or Boston But dont forget your Hbomb will only be as good as the Abombs in it If you want to spend a little more money you can punchup your Abomb considerably Instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand you can buy a commercial centrifuge Fisher Scientific sells one for about 1000 You also might want to be fussier about your design The Hiroshima bomb a relatively crude one only fissioned 1 percent of its uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons In order to fission more of the uranium the force of your explosive trigger needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously It was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of trying to steal  Part 2 Putting Your HBomb Together The heart of the Hbomb is the fusion process Several Abombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature 100 million degrees C necessary to fuse lithium deuteride LiD into helium When the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus two helium nuclei are created and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough the result is an enormous amount of energy the energy of the Hbomb You dont have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride it can be purchased from any chemicalsupply house It costs 1000 a pound If your budget wont allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at 40 a pound You will need at least 100 pounds Its a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful Place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four Abombs in their casings Attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously The container for the whole thing is no problem They can be placed anywhere Inside an old stereo console a discarded refrigerator etc When the detonator sets off the four Abombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations This will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees C fast enough a few billionths of a second so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse The result at least 1000 times the punch of the puny Abomb that leveled Hiroshima 20 million tons of TNT vs 20 thousand tons  Part 3 What to do With Your Bomb Now that you have a fully assembled Hbomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering What should I do with it Every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the American government 1 Sell Your Bomb and Make a Pile of Money In these days of rising inflation increasing unemployment and an uncertain economic outlook few businesses make as much sense as weapons production If your career forecast is cloudy bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare or unemployment Regardless of your present income level a home Hbomb business can be an invaluable income supplement and certainly a profitable alternative to selling Tupperware or pirated Girl Scout cookies Unfortunately for the family bomb business big government has already cornered a large part of the world market But this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers The raid on Entebee was the Waterloo of hijacking and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across Theyd jump at the chance to get hold of an Hbomb Emerging nations which cant ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from GE or Westinghouse are also shopping around You may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations or groups whose goals you may disapprove of But here again take a tip from our government forget ideology  its cash that counts And remember Hbomb sales have a way of escalating almost like a chain reaction Suppose you make a sale to South Yemen which you believe to be a Soviet puppet Well within a few days some discrete inquiries from North Yemen and possibly the Saudis the Egyptians and the Ethiopians as well can be expected Similarly a sale to the IRA will generate a sale to the Ulster government and a sale to the Tanzanians will bring the Ugandans running and so forth It doesnt matter WHICH side youre on only how many sides there are Dont forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer As the experience of both the US and the USSR has shown each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for Hbombs No customer  no matter how small  can ever have too many 2 Use Your Bomb at Home Many families are attracted to the Hbomb simply as a deterrent A discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying This Home Protected by Hbomb will discourage IRS investigators census takers and Jehovahs Witnesses Youll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up And once the news gets out that you are a home Hbomb owner youll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates So relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home Hbomb ownership  Is It For You Lets be honest The Hbomb isnt for everyone Frankly there are people who cant handle it They break out in hives at the very mention of megadeath fallout or radiation sickness The following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home Hbomb ownership If you can answer yes to six or more of these questions then youre emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club If not a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea try botulismtoxin laser rays or nerve gas 1 I ignore the demands of others 2 I subscribe to one or more of the following Soldier of Fortune Hustler Popular Mechanics Self 3 Though I have many interesting acquaintances I am my own best friend 4 I know what to say after you say Hello but I am seldom interested in pursuing the conversation 5 I have seen the movie The Deer Hunter more than once 6 I know that everyone can be a winner if they want to and I resent whiners 7 I own one or more of the following handgun video game trash compactor snowmobile 8 I am convinced that leukemia is psychosomatic 9 I am aware that most vegetarians are sexually impotent 10 I have read evidence that solar energy is a Communist conspiracy  Myths About Nuclear War Ever since the first mushroom cloud over Hiroshima ushered in the atomic age a small group of naysayers and doommongers has lobbied campaigned and demonstrated to convince Americans that Hbomb ownership along with nuclear power is dangerous and unhealthy Using their virtual stranglehold over the media these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war They have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many Americans feeling demoralized and indecisive not sure where the truth lies Well here are the myths and here are the facts Myth After a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation Fact This is completely false According to one scientist quoted in John McPees The Curve of Binding Energy The largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons and that is onethousandth the force of an earthquake onethousandth the force of a hurricane We have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time Another scientist adds It is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth That is far from the truth To end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world and probably a lot more Even if humans succumbed many forms of life would survive a nuclear freeforall cockroaches certain forms of bacteria and lichens for instance Myth Radiation is bad for you Fact Everything is bad for you if you have too much of it If you eat too many bananas youll get a stomachache If you get too much sun you can get sunburned or even skin cancer Same thing with radiation Too much may make you feel under the weather but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that lowlevel radiation has any really serious adverse effects And highlevel radiation may bring unexpected benefits It speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones Remember the old saying Two heads are better than one Nearer to home its plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes Many survivors of the Hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and its attendant problems forever We hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had Enjoy your HBomb

       "5                 I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning  We were talking about where Koreans put their money  Invariably they have a lot of real estate and cash  Cash would include short term investments under one year as well as savings accounts  The reason  Real estate makes money here  A lot of money  Ive seen surveys of Seoul real estate rising about 1015 PER YEAR for long stretches even after taking into account the 1997 Crisis referred to as the IMF crisis here although it was the IMF that bailed Korea out  Compare that to Korean corporate bonds which fell 9099 in 1997 and only modestly recovered and a local stock market represented by KOSPI or their version of the Dow Jones Index that has not gone appreciably above its 1980s high of 1000 points it is now about 800 points see  urlLink link  and you can see why real estate makes sense here  But back to the conversationI noted that here a real big or elite real estate investor has over 6 billion won about USD 5000000 see  urlLink converter  in properties  Dad seemed a little flabbergasted  What the heck do they need 5 million dollars for  They dont need that much to retire  Maybe so but there is a lot of risk here too  Take real estate or any other South Korean asset for example if the North toots their horn louder or make a move on the country that 5000000 USD is worth about 5 cents  Also all of it is denominated in won which during the IMF Crisis dropped about 50 visavis the USD Also if you make a bad investment or some fall victim to a scamthe latest here was the  urlLink Good Morning City  projectyoure toast  I saw a lady on TV who lost everything in it  Her comment between the tears Now I know what its like to go from a rich person to a beggar in one day  If you have one of those some saberrattling from North Korea and a weak exchange rate your little nest egg could be almost wiped out  The government has almost zero help for unemployed disabled or otherwise disenfranchised workers  The role of family is more important hereso if you have money you should help your family and if you dont then you should go to them first  Thus the idea that more is more  Koreans go all out in most things they do and investing is no different  Why have one apartment when you can have 7  The  urlLink jeonse  system supports this as well  You see if you have a 400000 USD apartment and you rent it out there are two systems you can use in Korea neither of which are the Western ones except in rare circumstances  1  Renter signs a 2year contract and deposits about half the market value 200000 USD with the owner  No monthly rent is paid but the owner can invest in Korean Treasury Bills for about 45 per year  Thats a monthly rentreturn of 750  At the end of the term the 200000 USD is returned to the renter  2  Renter signs a 1year or 2year contract and deposits about 1020 of the market value of the property 1000020000 USD plus some monthly rent of 400600 a month  In both cases if the value of the property increases or decreases the jeonse will need to be toppedup or partially refunded  Of course Im using USD in this to save my 0 key and to help foreigners reference it better  Thus if you buy a place for 400000 you can turn around and rent it out and get 200000 to if you like buy another place or whatever  Since there are very very few mortgages in Korea kind of a cash society although there are homeequity lines of credit the system here is a bit different  The key of course is that real estate prices keep going up

little effort you can be an active participant bomb shelters are for losers who wants to huddle together underground eating canned spam winners want to push the button themselves making your own hbomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training  its called taking charge were sure youll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken introduction when the feds clamped down on the progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb it piqued our curiosity was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an hbomb in your own kitchen seven days decided to find out food editor barbara ehrenreich investigative reporter peter biskind photographer jane melnick and nuclear scientist michio kaku were given three days to cook up a workable hbomb they did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you not that seven days supports nuclear terrorism we dont we would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like lowlevel radiation microwaves ddt dbcp aflatoxins pbbs pbcs or food dyes rather than unexpectedly say as hostage to a latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb in our view the real terrorists are the governments american soviet french chinese and british that are hoarding hbombs for their own use and worse still those governments us french and german that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like south africa brazil and argentina so that they can make their own bombs when these bombs are used and they will be it will be the worlds bigtime nuclear peddlers along with corporate suppliers like general electric westinghouse and gulf oil that we can thank for it gagging the progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out the heart of the successful hbomb is the successful abomb once youve got your abombs made the rest is frosting on the cake all you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate theyll start off a hydrogenfusion reaction  part 1 making your bomb step 1 getting the ingredients uranium is the basic ingredient of the abomb when a uranium atoms nucleus splits apart it releases a tremendous amount of energy for its size and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei releasing more energy in what is called a chain reaction when atoms split matter is converted into energy according to einsteins equation emc2 what better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks there are two kinds isotopes of uranium the rare u235 used in bombs and the more common heavier but useless u238 natural uranium contains less than 1 percent u235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be enriched to 90 percent u235 and only 10 percent u238 plutonium239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for u235 ten pounds of u235 or slightly less plutonium is all that is necessary for a bomb less than ten pounds wont give you a critical mass so purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle it is infinitely easy to steal readytouse enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself and stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds there are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in portsmouth ohio from there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of u235 and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment conversion facilities exist at hematite missouri apollo pennsylvania and erwin tennessee the kerrmcgee plant at crescent oklahoma  where karen silkwood worked  was a conversion plant that lost 40 lbs of plutonium enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuelfabricating plants like those in new haven san diego or lynchburg virginia a former kerrmcgee supervisor james v smith when asked at the silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft testified that there were none of any kind no guards no fences no nothing plutonium can be obtained from places like united nuclear in pawling new york nuclear fuel services in erwin tennessee general electric in pleasanton california westinghouse in cheswick pennsylvania nuclear materials and equipment corporation numec in leechburg pennsylvania and plants in hanfford washington and morris illinois according to rolling stone magazine the israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from numec finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while its enroute from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants it is usually transported by air or truck in the form of uranium oxide a brownish powder resembling instant coffee or as a metal coming in small chunks called broken buttons both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums the drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked fissible material or danger plutonium a typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at portsmouth ohio to the conversion plant in hematite missouri then to kansas city by truck where it would be flown to los angeles and then trucked down to the general atomic plant in san diego the plans for the general atomic plant are on file at the nuclear regulatory commissions reading room at 1717 h street nw washington a xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public if you cant get hold of any enriched uranium youll have to settle for commercial grade 20 percent u235 this can be stolen from university reactors of a type called triga mark ii where security is even more casual than at commercial plants if stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for 23 a pound commercial grade 3 to 20 percent enriched is available for 40 a pound from gulf atomic youll have to enrich it further yourself quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass youll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercialgrade uranium its only 20 percent u235 at best and you need 10 pounds of u235 so  but with a little kitchentable chemistry youll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide youve purchased into a liquid form once youve done that youll be able to separate the u235 that youll need from the u238 first pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide converting it to uranium tetrafluoride safety note concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass so store it only in plastic used 1gallon plastic milk containers will do now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride the gaseous form of uranium which is convenient for separating out the isotope u235 from u238 to get the hexafluoride form bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemicalsupply firms be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine the classic world war i poison gas chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors if youve done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching in the old horseandbuggy days of abomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes tubes and membranes until the u235 was eventually separated from the u238 this gaseousdiffusion process as it was called is difficult timeconsuming and expensive gaseousdiffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of 2billion each so forget it there are easier and cheaper ways to enrich your uranium first transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure you can use a bicycle pump for this then make a simple home centrifuge fill a standardsize bucket onequarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride attach a sixfoot rope to the bucket handle now swing the rope and attached bucket around your head as fast as possible keep this up for about 45 minutes slow down gradually and very gently put the bucket on the floor the u235 which is lighter will have risen to the top where it can be skimmed off like cream repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium safety note dont put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room this will prevent the premature buildup of a critical mass now its time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form this is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium available in tablet form from your drugstore into each bucket of uranium the calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal a few precautions  while uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts youll be handling if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron the kind you can buy in dental supply stores  plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known if inhaled a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs a painful way to go even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer if eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium it goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells the best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it if this is too difficult wear a mask to avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule never make an abomb on an empty stomach  if you find yourself dozing off while youre working or if you begin to glow in the dark it might be wise to take a blood count prick your finger with a sterile pin place a drop of blood on a microscope slide cover it with a cover slip and examine under a microscope best results are obtained in the early morning when you get leukemia immature cells are released into the bloodstream and usually the number of white cells increases though this increase might take almost 2 weeks red blood cells look kind of like donuts without the hole and are slightly smaller than the white cells each of which has a nucleus immature red cells look similar to white cells ie slightly larger and have a nucleus if you have more than about 1 white cell including immature ones to 400 red cells then start to worry but depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb a short life expectancy might not be a problem  step 2 assembling the abomb now that youve acquired the enriched uranium all thats left is to assemble your abomb go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls you also want to separate your 10 pounds of u235 into two hunks keep them apart the idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl uranium is malleable like gold so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit take another fivepound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl these two bowls of u235 are the subcritical masses which when brought together forcefully will provide the critical mass that makes your abomb go keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you dont want them to go critical on you at least not yet now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside open ends facing each other no less than seven inches apart using masking tape to set them up in position the reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner in case youre wondering is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion a loose neutron is a useless neutron as the abomb pioneers used to say as far as the abomb goes youre almost done the final problem is to figure out how to get the two u235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together gunpowder for example is easily made at home from potassium nitrate sulfur and carbon or you can get some blasting caps or tnt buy them or steal them from a construction site best of all is c4 plastic explosive you can mold it around your bowls and its fairly safe to work with but it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room and then fit it to your uraniumpacked bowls this is particularly true in winter when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the c4 a responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries a switch and some wire remember though that it is essential that the two charges  one on each side of the casing  go off simultaneously now put the whole thing in the casing of an old hoover vacuum cleaner and youre finished with this part of the process the rest is easy  step 3 make more abombs following the directions above  a word to the wise about wastes after your abomb is completed youll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like u238 these are not dangerous but you do have to get rid of them you can flush leftovers down the toilet dont worry about polluting the ocean there is already so much radioactive waste there a few more bucketfuls wont make any waves whatsoever if youre the fastidious type  the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies  you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard just like uncle sam does if the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn tell them to play over by the waste youll soon find that theyre spending most of their time in bed  going first class if youre like us youre feeling the economic pinch and youll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible consonant of course with reasonable yield the recipe weve given is for a budgetpleasing hbomb no frills no flourishes its just a simple 5megaton bomb capable of wiping out the new york metropolitan area the san francisco bay area or boston but dont forget your hbomb will only be as good as the abombs in it if you want to spend a little more money you can punchup your abomb considerably instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand you can buy a commercial centrifuge fisher scientific sells one for about 1000 you also might want to be fussier about your design the hiroshima bomb a relatively crude one only fissioned 1 percent of its uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons in order to fission more of the uranium the force of your explosive trigger needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously it was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused julius and ethel rosenberg of trying to steal  part 2 putting your hbomb together the heart of the hbomb is the fusion process several abombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature 100 million degrees c necessary to fuse lithium deuteride lid into helium when the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus two helium nuclei are created and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough the result is an enormous amount of energy the energy of the hbomb you dont have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride it can be purchased from any chemicalsupply house it costs 1000 a pound if your budget wont allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at 40 a pound you will need at least 100 pounds its a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four abombs in their casings attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously the container for the whole thing is no problem they can be placed anywhere inside an old stereo console a discarded refrigerator etc when the detonator sets off the four abombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations this will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees c fast enough a few billionths of a second so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse the result at least 1000 times the punch of the puny abomb that leveled hiroshima 20 million tons of tnt vs 20 thousand tons  part 3 what to do with your bomb now that you have a fully assembled hbomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering what should i do with it every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the american government 1 sell your bomb and make a pile of money in these days of rising inflation increasing unemployment and an uncertain economic outlook few businesses make as much sense as weapons production if your career forecast is cloudy bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare or unemployment regardless of your present income level a home hbomb business can be an invaluable income supplement and certainly a profitable alternative to selling tupperware or pirated girl scout cookies unfortunately for the family bomb business big government has already cornered a large part of the world market but this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers the raid on entebee was the waterloo of hijacking and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across theyd jump at the chance to get hold of an hbomb emerging nations which cant ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from ge or westinghouse are also shopping around you may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations or groups whose goals you may disapprove of but here again take a tip from our government forget ideology  its cash that counts and remember hbomb sales have a way of escalating almost like a chain reaction suppose you make a sale to south yemen which you believe to be a soviet puppet well within a few days some discrete inquiries from north yemen and possibly the saudis the egyptians and the ethiopians as well can be expected similarly a sale to the ira will generate a sale to the ulster government and a sale to the tanzanians will bring the ugandans running and so forth it doesnt matter which side youre on only how many sides there are dont forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer as the experience of both the us and the ussr has shown each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for hbombs no customer  no matter how small  can ever have too many 2 use your bomb at home many families are attracted to the hbomb simply as a deterrent a discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying this home protected by hbomb will discourage irs investigators census takers and jehovahs witnesses youll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up and once the news gets out that you are a home hbomb owner youll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates so relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home hbomb ownership  is it for you lets be honest the hbomb isnt for everyone frankly there are people who cant handle it they break out in hives at the very mention of megadeath fallout or radiation sickness the following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home hbomb ownership if you can answer yes to six or more of these questions then youre emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club if not a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea try botulismtoxin laser rays or nerve gas 1 i ignore the demands of others 2 i subscribe to one or more of the following soldier of fortune hustler popular mechanics self 3 though i have many interesting acquaintances i am my own best friend 4 i know what to say after you say hello but i am seldom interested in pursuing the conversation 5 i have seen the movie the deer hunter more than once 6 i know that everyone can be a winner if they want to and i resent whiners 7 i own one or more of the following handgun video game trash compactor snowmobile 8 i am convinced that leukemia is psychosomatic 9 i am aware that most vegetarians are sexually impotent 10 i have read evidence that solar energy is a communist conspiracy  myths about nuclear war ever since the first mushroom cloud over hiroshima ushered in the atomic age a small group of naysayers and doommongers has lobbied campaigned and demonstrated to convince americans that hbomb ownership along with nuclear power is dangerous and unhealthy using their virtual stranglehold over the media these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war they have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many americans feeling demoralized and indecisive not sure where the truth lies well here are the myths and here are the facts myth after a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation fact this is completely false according to one scientist quoted in john mcpees the curve of binding energy the largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons and that is onethousandth the force of an earthquake onethousandth the force of a hurricane we have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time another scientist adds it is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth that is far from the truth to end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world and probably a lot more even if humans succumbed many forms of life would survive a nuclear freeforall cockroaches certain forms of bacteria and lichens for instance myth radiation is bad for you fact everything is bad for you if you have too much of it if you eat too many bananas youll get a stomachache if you get too much sun you can get sunburned or even skin cancer same thing with radiation too much may make you feel under the weather but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that lowlevel radiation has any really serious adverse effects and highlevel radiation may bring unexpected benefits it speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones remember the old saying two heads are better than one nearer to home its plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes many survivors of the hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and its attendant problems forever we hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had enjoy your hbomb

       "5                 i had an interesting conversation with my dad this morning  we were talking about where koreans put their money  invariably they have a lot of real estate and cash  cash would include short term investments under one year as well as savings accounts  the reason  real estate makes money here  a lot of money  ive seen surveys of seoul real estate rising about 1015 per year for long stretches even after taking into account the 1997 crisis referred to as the imf crisis here although it was the imf that bailed korea out  compare that to korean corporate bonds which fell 9099 in 1997 and only modestly recovered and a local stock market represented by kospi or their version of the dow jones index that has not gone appreciably above its 1980s high of 1000 points it is now about 800 points see  urllink link  and you can see why real estate makes sense here  but back to the conversationi noted that here a real big or elite real estate investor has over 6 billion won about usd 5000000 see  urllink converter  in properties  dad seemed a little flabbergasted  what the heck do they need 5 million dollars for  they dont need that much to retire  maybe so but there is a lot of risk here too  take real estate or any other south korean asset for example if the north toots their horn louder or make a move on the country that 5000000 usd is worth about 5 cents  also all of it is denominated in won which during the imf crisis dropped about 50 visavis the usd also if you make a bad investment or some fall victim to a scamthe latest here was the  urllink good morning city  projectyoure toast  i saw a lady on tv who lost everything in it  her comment between the tears now i know what its like to go from a rich person to a beggar in one day  if you have one of those some saberrattling from north korea and a weak exchange rate your little nest egg could be almost wiped out  the government has almost zero help for unemployed disabled or otherwise disenfranchised workers  the role of family is more important hereso if you have money you should help your family and if you dont then you should go to them first  thus the idea that more is more  koreans go all out in most things they do and investing is no different  why have one apartment when you can have 7  the  urllink jeonse  system supports this as well  you see if you have a 400000 usd apartment and you rent it out there are two systems you can use in korea neither of which are the western ones except in rare circumstances  1  renter signs a 2year contract and deposits about half the market value 200000 usd with the owner  no monthly rent is paid but the owner can invest in korean treasury bills for about 45 per year  thats a monthly rentreturn of 750  at the end of the term the 200000 usd is returned to the renter  2  renter signs a 1year or 2year contract and deposits about 1020 of the market value of the property 1000020000 usd plus some monthly rent of 400600 a month  in both cases if the value of the property increases or decreases the jeonse will need to be toppedup or partially refunded  of course im using usd in this to save my 0 key and to help foreigners reference it better  thus if you buy a place for 400000 you can turn around and rent it out and get 200000 to if you like buy another place or whatever  since there are very very few mortgages in korea kind of a cash society although there are homeequity lines of credit the system here is a bit different  the key of course is that real estate prices keep going up

can be an active participant bomb shelters are for losers who wants to huddle together underground eating canned spam winners want to push the button themselves making your own hbomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training its called taking charge were sure youll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken introduction when the feds clamped down on the progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb it piqued our curiosity was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an hbomb in your own kitchen seven days decided to find out food editor barbara ehrenreich investigative reporter peter biskind photographer jane melnick and nuclear scientist michio kaku were given three days to cook up a workable hbomb they did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you not that seven days supports nuclear terrorism we dont we would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like lowlevel radiation microwaves ddt dbcp aflatoxins pbbs pbcs or food dyes rather than unexpectedly say as hostage to a latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb in our view the real terrorists are the governments american soviet french chinese and british that are hoarding hbombs for their own use and worse still those governments us french and german that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like south africa brazil and argentina so that they can make their own bombs when these bombs are used and they will be it will be the worlds bigtime nuclear peddlers along with corporate suppliers like general electric westinghouse and gulf oil that we can thank for it gagging the progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out the heart of the successful hbomb is the successful abomb once youve got your abombs made the rest is frosting on the cake all you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate theyll start off a hydrogenfusion reaction part 1 making your bomb step 1 getting the ingredients uranium is the basic ingredient of the abomb when a uranium atoms nucleus splits apart it releases a tremendous amount of energy for its size and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei releasing more energy in what is called a chain reaction when atoms split matter is converted into energy according to einsteins equation emc2 what better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks there are two kinds isotopes of uranium the rare u235 used in bombs and the more common heavier but useless u238 natural uranium contains less than 1 percent u235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be enriched to 90 percent u235 and only 10 percent u238 plutonium239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for u235 ten pounds of u235 or slightly less plutonium is all that is necessary for a bomb less than ten pounds wont give you a critical mass so purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle it is infinitely easy to steal readytouse enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself and stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds there are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in portsmouth ohio from there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of u235 and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment conversion facilities exist at hematite missouri apollo pennsylvania and erwin tennessee the kerrmcgee plant at crescent oklahoma where karen silkwood worked was a conversion plant that lost 40 lbs of plutonium enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuelfabricating plants like those in new haven san diego or lynchburg virginia a former kerrmcgee supervisor james v smith when asked at the silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft testified that there were none of any kind no guards no fences no nothing plutonium can be obtained from places like united nuclear in pawling new york nuclear fuel services in erwin tennessee general electric in pleasanton california westinghouse in cheswick pennsylvania nuclear materials and equipment corporation numec in leechburg pennsylvania and plants in hanfford washington and morris illinois according to rolling stone magazine the israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from numec finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while its enroute from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants it is usually transported by air or truck in the form of uranium oxide a brownish powder resembling instant coffee or as a metal coming in small chunks called broken buttons both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums the drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked fissible material or danger plutonium a typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at portsmouth ohio to the conversion plant in hematite missouri then to kansas city by truck where it would be flown to los angeles and then trucked down to the general atomic plant in san diego the plans for the general atomic plant are on file at the nuclear regulatory commissions reading room at 1717 h street nw washington a xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public if you cant get hold of any enriched uranium youll have to settle for commercial grade 20 percent u235 this can be stolen from university reactors of a type called triga mark ii where security is even more casual than at commercial plants if stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for 23 a pound commercial grade 3 to 20 percent enriched is available for 40 a pound from gulf atomic youll have to enrich it further yourself quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass youll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercialgrade uranium its only 20 percent u235 at best and you need 10 pounds of u235 so but with a little kitchentable chemistry youll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide youve purchased into a liquid form once youve done that youll be able to separate the u235 that youll need from the u238 first pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide converting it to uranium tetrafluoride safety note concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass so store it only in plastic used 1gallon plastic milk containers will do now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride the gaseous form of uranium which is convenient for separating out the isotope u235 from u238 to get the hexafluoride form bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemicalsupply firms be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine the classic world war i poison gas chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors if youve done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching in the old horseandbuggy days of abomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes tubes and membranes until the u235 was eventually separated from the u238 this gaseousdiffusion process as it was called is difficult timeconsuming and expensive gaseousdiffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of 2billion each so forget it there are easier and cheaper ways to enrich your uranium first transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure you can use a bicycle pump for this then make a simple home centrifuge fill a standardsize bucket onequarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride attach a sixfoot rope to the bucket handle now swing the rope and attached bucket around your head as fast as possible keep this up for about 45 minutes slow down gradually and very gently put the bucket on the floor the u235 which is lighter will have risen to the top where it can be skimmed off like cream repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium safety note dont put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room this will prevent the premature buildup of a critical mass now its time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form this is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium available in tablet form from your drugstore into each bucket of uranium the calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal a few precautions while uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts youll be handling if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron the kind you can buy in dental supply stores plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known if inhaled a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs a painful way to go even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer if eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium it goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells the best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it if this is too difficult wear a mask to avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule never make an abomb on an empty stomach if you find yourself dozing off while youre working or if you begin to glow in the dark it might be wise to take a blood count prick your finger with a sterile pin place a drop of blood on a microscope slide cover it with a cover slip and examine under a microscope best results are obtained in the early morning when you get leukemia immature cells are released into the bloodstream and usually the number of white cells increases though this increase might take almost 2 weeks red blood cells look kind of like donuts without the hole and are slightly smaller than the white cells each of which has a nucleus immature red cells look similar to white cells ie slightly larger and have a nucleus if you have more than about 1 white cell including immature ones to 400 red cells then start to worry but depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb a short life expectancy might not be a problem step 2 assembling the abomb now that youve acquired the enriched uranium all thats left is to assemble your abomb go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls you also want to separate your 10 pounds of u235 into two hunks keep them apart the idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl uranium is malleable like gold so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit take another fivepound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl these two bowls of u235 are the subcritical masses which when brought together forcefully will provide the critical mass that makes your abomb go keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you dont want them to go critical on you at least not yet now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside open ends facing each other no less than seven inches apart using masking tape to set them up in position the reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner in case youre wondering is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion a loose neutron is a useless neutron as the abomb pioneers used to say as far as the abomb goes youre almost done the final problem is to figure out how to get the two u235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together gunpowder for example is easily made at home from potassium nitrate sulfur and carbon or you can get some blasting caps or tnt buy them or steal them from a construction site best of all is c4 plastic explosive you can mold it around your bowls and its fairly safe to work with but it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room and then fit it to your uraniumpacked bowls this is particularly true in winter when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the c4 a responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries a switch and some wire remember though that it is essential that the two charges one on each side of the casing go off simultaneously now put the whole thing in the casing of an old hoover vacuum cleaner and youre finished with this part of the process the rest is easy step 3 make more abombs following the directions above a word to the wise about wastes after your abomb is completed youll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like u238 these are not dangerous but you do have to get rid of them you can flush leftovers down the toilet dont worry about polluting the ocean there is already so much radioactive waste there a few more bucketfuls wont make any waves whatsoever if youre the fastidious type the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard just like uncle sam does if the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn tell them to play over by the waste youll soon find that theyre spending most of their time in bed going first class if youre like us youre feeling the economic pinch and youll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible consonant of course with reasonable yield the recipe weve given is for a budgetpleasing hbomb no frills no flourishes its just a simple 5megaton bomb capable of wiping out the new york metropolitan area the san francisco bay area or boston but dont forget your hbomb will only be as good as the abombs in it if you want to spend a little more money you can punchup your abomb considerably instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand you can buy a commercial centrifuge fisher scientific sells one for about 1000 you also might want to be fussier about your design the hiroshima bomb a relatively crude one only fissioned 1 percent of its uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons in order to fission more of the uranium the force of your explosive trigger needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously it was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused julius and ethel rosenberg of trying to steal part 2 putting your hbomb together the heart of the hbomb is the fusion process several abombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature 100 million degrees c necessary to fuse lithium deuteride lid into helium when the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus two helium nuclei are created and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough the result is an enormous amount of energy the energy of the hbomb you dont have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride it can be purchased from any chemicalsupply house it costs 1000 a pound if your budget wont allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at 40 a pound you will need at least 100 pounds its a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four abombs in their casings attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously the container for the whole thing is no problem they can be placed anywhere inside an old stereo console a discarded refrigerator etc when the detonator sets off the four abombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations this will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees c fast enough a few billionths of a second so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse the result at least 1000 times the punch of the puny abomb that leveled hiroshima 20 million tons of tnt vs 20 thousand tons part 3 what to do with your bomb now that you have a fully assembled hbomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering what should i do with it every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the american government 1 sell your bomb and make a pile of money in these days of rising inflation increasing unemployment and an uncertain economic outlook few businesses make as much sense as weapons production if your career forecast is cloudy bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare or unemployment regardless of your present income level a home hbomb business can be an invaluable income supplement and certainly a profitable alternative to selling tupperware or pirated girl scout cookies unfortunately for the family bomb business big government has already cornered a large part of the world market but this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers the raid on entebee was the waterloo of hijacking and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across theyd jump at the chance to get hold of an hbomb emerging nations which cant ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from ge or westinghouse are also shopping around you may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations or groups whose goals you may disapprove of but here again take a tip from our government forget ideology its cash that counts and remember hbomb sales have a way of escalating almost like a chain reaction suppose you make a sale to south yemen which you believe to be a soviet puppet well within a few days some discrete inquiries from north yemen and possibly the saudis the egyptians and the ethiopians as well can be expected similarly a sale to the ira will generate a sale to the ulster government and a sale to the tanzanians will bring the ugandans running and so forth it doesnt matter which side youre on only how many sides there are dont forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer as the experience of both the us and the ussr has shown each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for hbombs no customer no matter how small can ever have too many 2 use your bomb at home many families are attracted to the hbomb simply as a deterrent a discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying this home protected by hbomb will discourage irs investigators census takers and jehovahs witnesses youll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up and once the news gets out that you are a home hbomb owner youll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates so relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home hbomb ownership is it for you lets be honest the hbomb isnt for everyone frankly there are people who cant handle it they break out in hives at the very mention of megadeath fallout or radiation sickness the following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home hbomb ownership if you can answer yes to six or more of these questions then youre emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club if not a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea try botulismtoxin laser rays or nerve gas 1 i ignore the demands of others 2 i subscribe to one or more of the following soldier of fortune hustler popular mechanics self 3 though i have many interesting acquaintances i am my own best friend 4 i know what to say after you say hello but i am seldom interested in pursuing the conversation 5 i have seen the movie the deer hunter more than once 6 i know that everyone can be a winner if they want to and i resent whiners 7 i own one or more of the following handgun video game trash compactor snowmobile 8 i am convinced that leukemia is psychosomatic 9 i am aware that most vegetarians are sexually impotent 10 i have read evidence that solar energy is a communist conspiracy myths about nuclear war ever since the first mushroom cloud over hiroshima ushered in the atomic age a small group of naysayers and doommongers has lobbied campaigned and demonstrated to convince americans that hbomb ownership along with nuclear power is dangerous and unhealthy using their virtual stranglehold over the media these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war they have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many americans feeling demoralized and indecisive not sure where the truth lies well here are the myths and here are the facts myth after a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation fact this is completely false according to one scientist quoted in john mcpees the curve of binding energy the largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons and that is onethousandth the force of an earthquake onethousandth the force of a hurricane we have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time another scientist adds it is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth that is far from the truth to end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world and probably a lot more even if humans succumbed many forms of life would survive a nuclear freeforall cockroaches certain forms of bacteria and lichens for instance myth radiation is bad for you fact everything is bad for you if you have too much of it if you eat too many bananas youll get a stomachache if you get too much sun you can get sunburned or even skin cancer same thing with radiation too much may make you feel under the weather but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that lowlevel radiation has any really serious adverse effects and highlevel radiation may bring unexpected benefits it speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones remember the old saying two heads are better than one nearer to home its plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes many survivors of the hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and its attendant problems forever we hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had enjoy your hbomb\n",

       "5    i had an interesting conversation with my dad this morning we were talking about where koreans put their money invariably they have a lot of real estate and cash cash would include short term investments under one year as well as savings accounts the reason real estate makes money here a lot of money ive seen surveys of seoul real estate rising about 1015 per year for long stretches even after taking into account the 1997 crisis referred to as the imf crisis here although it was the imf that bailed korea out compare that to korean corporate bonds which fell 9099 in 1997 and only modestly recovered and a local stock market represented by kospi or their version of the dow jones index that has not gone appreciably above its 1980s high of 1000 points it is now about 800 points see urllink link and you can see why real estate makes sense here but back to the conversationi noted that here a real big or elite real estate investor has over 6 billion won about usd 5000000 see urllink converter in properties dad seemed a little flabbergasted what the heck do they need 5 million dollars for they dont need that much to retire maybe so but there is a lot of risk here too take real estate or any other south korean asset for example if the north toots their horn louder or make a move on the country that 5000000 usd is worth about 5 cents also all of it is denominated in won which during the imf crisis dropped about 50 visavis the usd also if you make a bad investment or some fall victim to a scamthe latest here was the urllink good morning city projectyoure toast i saw a lady on tv who lost everything in it her comment between the tears now i know what its like to go from a rich person to a beggar in one day if you have one of those some saberrattling from north korea and a weak exchange rate your little nest egg could be almost wiped out the government has almost zero help for unemployed disabled or otherwise disenfranchised workers the role of family is more important hereso if you have money you should help your family and if you dont then you should go to them first thus the idea that more is more koreans go all out in most things they do and investing is no different why have one apartment when you can have 7 the urllink jeonse system supports this as well you see if you have a 400000 usd apartment and you rent it out there are two systems you can use in korea neither of which are the western ones except in rare circumstances 1 renter signs a 2year contract and deposits about half the market value 200000 usd with the owner no monthly rent is paid but the owner can invest in korean treasury bills for about 45 per year thats a monthly rentreturn of 750 at the end of the term the 200000 usd is returned to the renter 2 renter signs a 1year or 2year contract and deposits about 1020 of the market value of the property 1000020000 usd plus some monthly rent of 400600 a month in both cases if the value of the property increases or decreases the jeonse will need to be toppedup or partially refunded of course im using usd in this to save my 0 key and to help foreigners reference it better thus if you buy a place for 400000 you can turn around and rent it out and get 200000 to if you like buy another place or whatever since there are very very few mortgages in korea kind of a cash society although there are homeequity lines of credit the system here is a bit different the key of course is that real estate prices keep going up

    "#### Observation:\n",
    " - Train accuracy is 45% and Test accuracy is 9.5%\n",
    " - We are not able to get good accuracy when we are applying Bag Of Words model using count vectorizer to extract features\n",
    " - When we are combining four different target columns having 80 classes, the classifier is not able to predict the classes accurately\n",
    " - One reason for the mis-classification could be, age being one of the multilabels which has discrete values\n",
    " - If we consider only of the features like gender or topic as a target for classification, we could see good accuracy\n",
    " - Combining only gender and topic or sign and topic for multiclass classification could better the results.\n"
